This repository is a copy from sta314's repository, which is fully functioning, 
well written and well documented.
The version here can be used for chess board corner detection only. Detection is achieved with 
conventional image processing techniques (Open Cv, Canny edge detetection and Hough line 
transformation in a rather complicated and slow pipeline. The corner coordinates can be 
saved in a file for later use. 
The program parts concerning piece detection with Yolo were deactivated.
The program was intended to run on a Nvidia Jetson Xavier. I wanted to avoid mouse 
clicks to identify chess board corners on images with chess boards.
The program is slow but reliable and corner detection was much superior than the methods I tried
using a cnn and yolo.
